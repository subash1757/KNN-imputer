# KNN-imputer
KNNimputer is a scikit-learn class used to fill out or predict the missing values in a dataset. It is a more useful method which works on the basic approach of the KNN algorithm rather than the naive approach of filling all the values with mean or the median. In this approach, we specify a distance from the missing values which is also known as the K parameter. The missing value will be predicted in reference to the mean of the neighbours.
